# 4chanScraper
4chan python image scraper


Parses all 10 pages and scrapes all the imgs on the front pages. 
Currently doesn't go within threads to scrape all img's, that's another project for anotherday.
Also it currently saves every image as a jpeg, working on saving in orginal format.

Requires BeatifulSoup and requests to run.

uses python 2.7,

pip install requests

pip install beautifulsoup4

Currently the working directory is "DIR="C:\\Users\\deez\\Desktop\\test\\"" so change it to wherever you want it to dump the images.
